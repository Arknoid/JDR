# Project-RPG
 
## Development branch

---
It is a branch of development in order to pass the project in ES6 with Webpack and I hope to migrate the project from Jquery to React.Js

---

Use Npm or Yarn to install the project :

    npm install

    npm start



All code is under license M.I.T 

All artworks are  for now on under license CC and come from various artists on Devianart.
