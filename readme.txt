Project-RPG,

Is an open source project whose goal is to highlight the techniques learned during my training at O'clock web dev school :
Javascript Html and Css.
It is also in some sort my technical laboratory before embarking on a larger project.

All artworks are  for now on under license CC and come from various artists on Devianart
