#Project-RPG



https://arknoid.github.io/project-RPG/

An open source project whose goal is to highlight the basic front techniques learned during my training at O'clock web dev school for now:

- Javascript and Jquery
- Html and Css.
- go further in object programming

It is also in some sort my technical laboratory  before embarking on a larger project.

All code is under license M.I.T and do exclusively with open source software.

All artworks are  for now on under license CC and come from various artists on Devianart.
